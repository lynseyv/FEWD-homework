			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<blockquote><p>Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen. And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! Let's see some bananas and nuts! Even it means me taking a chubby… I will suck it up. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? Hair up, glasses off. She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. Hair up, glasses off. How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces.</p>

			<p>I'll sacrifice anything for my children. Don't call my escorts whores. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways.No, Pop-pop does not get a treat. I just bought you a f**king pizza. You might enjoy this.  Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing. Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's left of your uncle. </p>

			<p>Oh please. They didn't sneak into this country to be your friends. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. I didn't mean who… I meant… her? You're Killing Me, Buster. </p>

			<p>I'm gonna go get sexy. Now, do you wanna steer, or are you too old to sit on your Pop's lap and drive? That's my son, you pothead! Talk you off what, Pop Pop? Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup.</p> </blockquote>
